      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>We at Gala Emporium help clubs market their events and host their events in our venue.
        We have been in the business for over 20 years, and we strive to host the best events and make our clients happy.
        We sit down with our clients and plan the events so that you as a client feel that you have control of every step of 
        the event planning.
